They all have same length, why don\\u2019t we\\nextract them all and store them separately with small modification: instead of length \\u2014 let\\u2019s store start offset into the raw data (stored separately). Length is\\ntrivially calculated as a difference between two adjacent offsets. This way we can immediately jump to any record by first finding its offset in the LUT (simple\\narithmetic: LUT consists of entries of size S, so offset to zero-based entry N in LUT is N * S) reading LUT at this offset gives us position of our record. Updating\\nany of the records would require overwriting all the data that follows that record as well as recalculating all offsets of the affected records, but we can easily\\nappend records. Depending on our needs we can even avoid having to have two files \\u2014 one with LUT and one with raw data: just store data, then LUT, then a\\nsingle number that tells offset of the LUT. This way we can trivially find both data and LUT as well as add records without overwriting entire file.
